## Cleaning names

Let's say that we already have technically clean names - in that they don't have spaces or punctuation or start with a number. However, let's say that there is a redundant word ("percent") that we want to remove or add to multiple columns.

The `janitor` package can be really helpful for this!

First let's load the packages we will need. We will show some functions from   `janitor` and we need the `tidyverse`:

```{r}
# install.packages(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

First let's make some data:

```{r}
data_to_clean <- tibble(State = c("Texas", "Utah", "Maryland", "Ohio"),
                        tax_percent = c(10, 20, 60, 40),
                        literacy_percent = c(70, 80, 80, 75),
                        above_poverty_percent = c(60, 70, 50, 60))
data_to_clean

```



```{r}
data_to_clean %>% rename_with(~str_remove(., '_percent'))

```

Nice! That simplified our names very easily! We are using the `str_remove` function on all of our columns to remove the pattern `_percent` where it is found.

## What if we have really complicated names with numbers and punctuation?


We can use patterns with regex - see this [regex cheatsheet](https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf) for help to remove unwanted characters! We adpated some code from this [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71151470/remove-characters-from-column-names).

First we will make some very messy data:

```{r}

d <- tibble("Year" = 1:5,
       "Info" = 1:5,
       "1. Products" = 1:5,
       "2. Rate" = 1:5,
       "3. Price" = 1:5,
       "29. Other" = 1:5)
d
```

Now we can remove the numbers and punctuation in a similar way as we did before using `rename_with` and `str_remove`, but this time we specify a few things:

- that we want to remove digits with `[:digits:]` (based on the [regex cheatsheet](https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_strings.pdf))

- that we want to remove possibly multiple digits with the `+`

- that we want to remove a period (which needs two `\\` based on the cheatsheet too!) and a space

Here we go:

```{r}
d %>% 
  rename_with(~str_remove(., "[:digit:]+\\. "))

```

Nice, that is better!

## What if we have a row that has names we might want for columns?

First let's make some messy data that is missing values in the first row and has possible better column names in the second row. We adapted code from this [source](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/janitor.html#remove_constant-columns).

This can often happen when we read in data.

```{r}

dirt <- data.frame(X_1 = c(NA, "ID", 1:3),
           X_2 = c(NA, "Value", 4:6))

dirt
```


The function `row_to_names` can be really helpful for this. 

We can use the `row_number` argument of `row_to_names` to specify that the column names can be found in the second row.

```{r}
row_to_names(dirt, row_number = 2) # our column names can be found in row 2!

```
