Dear Students,
You are all registered for Introduction to R for Public Health Researchers.

Class will be 8:30AM-11:50AM EST June 8-12, 2020.

The class website is http://johnmuschelli.com/intro_to_r/ - we may be posting additional content the night before each class.  The syllabus is located here.  The CoursePlus website https://courseplus.jhu.edu/ should have drop boxes for homework and projects.

You must have a laptop to class, with the following software installed before the first class:
1. Please install the latest version of R for Windows or Mac: https://cran.r-project.org/ (version 4.0)
2. Please install the latest version of RStudio (Desktop): https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop
3.  Please follow the instructions in the video https://youtu.be/-m1c8Xz1ZCg for installing the tidyverse package.  
4.  If you are using a work computer, make sure you: Repeat this process for all of the packages in the text file attached to this email.
5.  Run the following code in R (to install the jhur package):

if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
	install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("muschellij2/jhur")


If you are using Mac OSX:
1) In the Terminal, run (copy and paste and hit enter): 
xcode-select --install
(this will ask you to agree to a user agreement) - this is installing extra tools that allow R packages to compile on your machine.
2) In the Terminal, run:
gfortran
If you see:
-bash: gfortran: command not found
then continue to steps 3 and 4
3) Install brew.  Go to the Terminal, run (copy and paste): 
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
4) Once that's done, run in the Terminal:
brew install gfortran


HOMEWORK 1:
Please complete the Modules for the Introduction to R: https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-r/lessons/introduction-to-r before class starts (it will make things easier).  Please complete only the free sections. 
Completing them is the first homework assignment due *Tuesday* before class (please upload a screenshot of the total completion).


See everyone on Monday!

Thanks,
John and Andrew
