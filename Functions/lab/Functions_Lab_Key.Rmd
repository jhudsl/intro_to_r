0. Load all the libraries we will use in this lab. 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

1. Create a function that takes one argument, a vector, and returns the sum of the vector squared. Call it "sum_squared". Test your function on the vector `c(2,7,21,30,90)` - you should get the answer 22500.

```{r}
x <- c(2,7,21,30,90)

sum_squared <- function(x) sum(x) ^ 2
sum_squared(x)

sum_squared <- function(x) {
  out <- sum(x) ^ 2
  return(out)
}
sum_squared(x)
```

2. Create a function that takes two arguments, (1) a vector and (2) a numeric value. This function tests whether the number (2) is contained within the vector (1). Call it "has_n". Test your function on the vector `c(2,7,21,30,90)` and number `21` - you should get the answer TRUE.

```{r}
x <- c(2,7,21,30,90)
n <- 21

has_n <- function(x, n) n %in% x
has_n(x, n)
```

3. Amend the function "has_n" from #2 so that it takes a default value of `21` for the numeric argument.

```{r}
x <- c(2,7,21,30,90)
n <- 21

has_n <- function(x, n = 21) n %in% x
has_n(x)
```

4. Read in the SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination data from http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/USA_covid19_vaccinations.csv. Assign the data the name "vacc".

```{r message=FALSE}
vacc <- read_csv("http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/USA_covid19_vaccinations.csv")
# If downloaded
# vacc <- read_csv("USA_covid19_vaccinations.csv")
```

5. We want to get some summary statistics on the Moderna vaccines. Use `across` inside `summarize` to get the sum total number vaccine doses for any variable containing the word "Moderna" or starting with "Total". **Hint**: use `matches()` AND `starts_with()` to select the right columns inside `across`. Keep in mind that this includes the United States as a whole and so is not totally accurate!

```{r}
vacc %>% 
  summarize(across(.cols = matches("Moderna") & starts_with("Total"), 
                   .fns = sum))
vacc %>% 
  summarize(across(.cols = matches("Moderna") & starts_with("Total"), 
                   .fns = sum,
                   na.rm = TRUE))
```

6. Use `across` and `mutate` to convert all columns containing the word "Percent" into proportions (i.e., divide that value by 100). **Hint**: use `matches()` to select the right columns. Use a "function on the fly" to divide by 100. It will also be easier to check your work if you `select()` columns that match "Percent".

```{r}
vacc %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = matches("Percent"), 
                .fns = function(x) x / 100)) %>% 
  select(matches("Percent"))
```

7. Use `across` and `mutate` to convert all columns starting with the word "Total" into a binary variable: TRUE if the value is greater than 10,000,000 and FALSE if less than or equal to 10,000,000. **Hint**: use `starts_with()` to select the columns starting with "Total". Use a "function on the fly" to do a logical test if the value is greater than 10,000,000.

```{r}
vacc %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = starts_with("Total"), 
                .fns = function(x) x > 10000000)) 
```

## BONUS

7. Take your code from #7 and assign it to the variable "vacc_dat". 

- Filter out the "United States" from `State/Territory/Federal Entity`. Make sure to reassign this to "vacc_dat"
- Create a ggplot boxplot (`geom_boxplot()`) where (1) the x-axis is `Total Doses Delivered` and (2) the y-axis is `Percent of fully vaccinated people with booster doses`.
- You change the `labs()` layer so that the x-axis is "Total Doses Delivered: Greater than 10,000,000"

```{r}
vacc_dat <- 
  vacc %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = starts_with("Total"), 
                .fns = function(x) x > 10000000)) %>% 
  filter(`State/Territory/Federal Entity` != "United States") 

ggplot(vacc_dat) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = `Total Doses Delivered`, 
                   y = `Percent of fully vaccinated people with booster doses`)) +
  labs(x = "Total Doses Delivered: Greater than 10,000,000")
```
