    In this lesson, we'll begin with a basic calculation. We will subtract 3 from 125.

    To perform this operation, type 125 - 3 into the code editor here and then click enter. The computer will then carry out the operation and return the result, 122.
  CorrectAnswer: 125 - 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='125 - 3')
  Hint: Try typing 125 - 3.

    In R programming, it's crucial to comprehend how values and their data types work. A key concept among these is literal values. A literal value is a part of a statement or expression used exactly as it is. For example, the numbers 125 and 3 are literal values because they represent the numbers 125 and 3 literally.

    Each literal value has a type, and in R, there are five basic data types: Logical, Integer, Numeric, Character, and Complex.

    Let's practice with numeric types some more. Try running 3 * 0.50 + 2 * 3.14 + 5 * 0.00009.
  CorrectAnswer: 3 * 0.50 + 2 * 3.14 + 5 * 0.00009
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='3 * 0.50 + 2 * 3.14 + 5 * 0.00009')
  Hint: Try typing 3 * 0.50 + 2 * 3.14 + 5 * 0.00009 and pressing enter.

    Let's look at a different type of data. Hit enter to continue.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    We're going to focus on the Logical data type now.

    Logical data type in R comprises two literals: TRUE and FALSE, or in their abbreviated forms, T and F. An important aspect to remember is that R is case-sensitive, which means it differentiates between uppercase and lowercase characters.

    Try typing TRUE into the console.
  CorrectAnswer: TRUE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='TRUE')
  Hint: Try typing TRUE and remember it is case sensitive.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    Now, try typing FALSE.
  CorrectAnswer: FALSE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='FALSE')
  Hint: Try typing FALSE and remember it is case sensitive.

    What about data in text form? Hit enter to continue.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |
    In R, the letters T, F, and their extended forms, TRUE and FALSE, serve specialized functions. However, there are occasions when we wish to treat words and characters purely as textual data. These are referred to as Character literals.

    Character literals are defined by placing them within quotation marks (") or single quotes ('). This encapsulation helps differentiate textual data from other literals in R, such as Integer, Logical, and Numeric.

    Examples include "Hello", "Good Morning", "100", "false" ... and so on.

    Is 'Howdy!' a character? Choose Yes or No below.
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: Check out the quotation marks.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |
    How about "3.14", is this a character? hoose Yes or No below.
  AnswerChoices: Yes;No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Yes')
  Hint: Check out the quotation marks.

    Nice work! Let's revisit some basic arithmetic. Hit enter to continue.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    We have the following operators:

    Addition (+)  
    
    Subtraction (-)  
    
    Multiplication (*)  
    
    Division (/)  

    Let's divide the number 5000 by 100.
  CorrectAnswer: 5000 / 100
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='5000 / 100')
  Hint: Type in 5000 / 100.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    Does spacing matter when doing arithmetic? Try typing 100*6.
  CorrectAnswer: 100*6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='100*6')
  Hint: Type in 100*6.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    Now try typing 100 * 6.
  CorrectAnswer: 100 * 6
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='100 * 6')
  Hint: Type in 100 * 6.

    While we can continue to type in literal values, a more efficient method would involve storing values to avoid manual repetition. The solution? Variables.

    Variables allow us to:

    1) Define a descriptive name.  
    
    2) Associate that name with a specific value or expression using the <- (less-than, dash) assignment operator.  

    Type and enter  
          
          apple_purchase_cost <- 2.75 * 10  
    
    in the console to store a variable called apple_purchase_cost.
  CorrectAnswer: apple_purchase_cost <- 2.75 * 10
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="apple_purchase_cost <- 2.75 * 10")
  Hint: Type in apple_purchase_cost <- 2.75 * 10 and hit enter.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
     Notice there is no output above!

     Enter apple_purchase_cost in the console and observe what happens.
  CorrectAnswer: apple_purchase_cost
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="apple_purchase_cost")
  Hint: Type in apple_purchase_cost and hit enter.

    R assumes we want to print the contents of the variable. Nice! 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: |
    Variable names follow a few rules. You should follow the following guidelines:

    1) Names can include letters (capital or lowercase), numbers, a dot (.), or an underscore (_).  
    
    2) Start the name with a letter or a dot. If starting with a dot, it shouldn't be followed by a number.  
    
    3) Avoid starting with a number.  
    
    4) Refrain from using special characters (like spaces, operator symbols, ", parentheses).  
    
    5) Keywords already recognized by R shouldn't be used as variable names.  

    Which of the following is an acceptable variable name?
  AnswerChoices: .2var;numberOfFruit;apple variable;"var";age20+
  CorrectAnswer: numberOfFruit
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='numberOfFruit')
  Hint: Check the criteria listed above. We want to name variables carefully!

  Output: Let's talk now about something called functions.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    Within R's extensive toolkit for data management and analysis, functions play a pivotal role. These are predefined operations designed to execute specific tasks. Functions are grouped into packages based on their functionality or specific application areas. R's default installation encompasses several essential packages, including the likes of base and stats.

    In this section, our emphasis will be on a basic yet critical function: class(). It serves to determine the data type of a specified variable or literal.
    
    Try typing class(apple_purchase_cost) in the console and hit enter.
  CorrectAnswer: class(apple_purchase_cost)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="class(apple_purchase_cost)")
  Hint: Type in class(apple_purchase_cost) and hit enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    Try using code to determine the class of the variable my_tool you created earlier.
  CorrectAnswer: class(my_tool)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="class(my_tool)")
  Hint: Type in class(my_tool) and hit enter.

  Output: Now let's talk a bit about relational operators.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    Relational operators in R are simple tools used to compare values. They help answer questions like "Is this value greater than that one?" or "Are these two values equal?". When you compare values using these operators, R will tell you whether the statement is TRUE or FALSE.
    
    Less Than (<)  
    
    Greater Than (>)  
    
    Less Than or Equal To (<=)  
    
    Greater Than or Equal To (>=)  
    
    Equal To (==)  
    
    Not Equal To (!=)  
    
    Try evaluating 100 > 1.
  CorrectAnswer: 100 > 1
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="100 > 1")
  Hint: Type in 100 > 1 and hit enter.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: |
    Now try 100 == 10*10.
  CorrectAnswer: 100 == 10*10
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="100 == 10*10")
  Hint: Type in 100 == 10*10 and hit enter.

- Class: cmd_question
