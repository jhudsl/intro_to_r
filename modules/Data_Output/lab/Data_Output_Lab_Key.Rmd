# Part 1

1.  Read in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data from URL 
http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/vaccinations.csv
and assign it to an object named `vacc`. 
```
# General format
library(readr)
# OBJECT <- read_csv(FILE)
```
```{r}
library(readr)
vacc <- read_csv(file = "http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/vaccinations.csv")
```


2. Filter the dataset so that the "Location" column is equal to "US" (aka the entire USA). Store the modified dataset as `vacc_filtered`.
```
# General format
NEW_OBJECT <- OBJECT %>% filter(COLUMNNAME == CRITERIA)
```
```{r}
vacc_filtered <- vacc %>% filter(Location == "US")
```


3. Write out the `vacc_filtered` object as a CSV file calling it "vacc_filtered.csv", using `write_csv()`:
```{r}
write_csv(vacc_filtered, file = "vacc_filtered.csv")
```


**Bonus / Extra practice**: Copy your code from problem 3 and modify it to write to the data directory inside your R Project. *Note: you may need to make a new folder named "data" if it doesn't already exist.*
```{r eval = FALSE}
getwd()
dir.create("data")
write_csv(vacc_filtered, file = "data/vacc_filtered.csv")
```


**Bonus / Extra practice**: Write one of the variables in your Environment to your working directory in `rds` format. Call the file `my_variable.rds`.
```{r}
y <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
write_rds(y, file = "my_variable.rds")
```


**Bonus / Extra practice**: Read the RDS file from your working directory back into your Environment. Call the file `z`.
```{r}
z <- read_rds(file = "my_variable.rds")
```
