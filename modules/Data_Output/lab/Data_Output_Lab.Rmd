In this lab you can use the interactive console to explore or **Knit** the document. 
Remember anything you type here can be "sent" to the console with Cmd-Enter (OS-X) or Ctrl-Enter (Windows/Linux) in an R code chunk.


# Part 1

1.  Read in SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data from URL 
http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/vaccinations.csv
and assign it to an object named `vacc`. 
```
# General format
library(readr)
# OBJECT <- read_csv(FILE)
```
```{r}

```


2. Filter the dataset so that the "Location" column is equal to "US" (aka the entire USA). Store the modified dataset as `vacc_filtered`.
```
# General format
NEW_OBJECT <- OBJECT %>% filter(COLUMNNAME == CRITERIA)
```
```{r}

```


3. Write out the `vacc_filtered` object as a CSV file calling it "vacc_filtered.csv", using `write_csv()`:
```{r}

```


**Bonus / Extra practice**: Copy your code from problem 3 and modify it to write to the data directory inside your R Project. *Note: you may need to make a new folder named "data" if it doesn't already exist.*
```{r eval = FALSE}

```


**Bonus / Extra practice**: Write one of the variables in your Environment to your working directory in `rds` format. Call the file `my_variable.rds`.
```{r}

```


**Bonus / Extra practice**: Read the RDS file from your working directory back into your Environment. Call the file `z`.
```{r}

```
