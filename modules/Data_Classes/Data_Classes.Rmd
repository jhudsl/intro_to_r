## Data classes/types

    * Character: strings or individual characters, quoted
    * Numeric: any real number(s)
    * Integer: any integer(s)/whole numbers (1,2,3)
    * Double: any number with fractional values (1.2, 4.01, 1.00004)
    * Factor: categorical/qualitative variables
    * Logical: variables composed of TRUE or FALSE
    * Date/POSIXct: represents calendar dates and times
    

## Character and numeric

We have already covered `character` and `numeric` types.

```{r numChar}
class(c("tree", "cloud", "stars_&_sky"))
class(c(1, 4, 7))
```

## Character and numeric

This can also be a bit tricky.

```{r numChar2}
class(c(1, 2, "tree"))
class(c("1", "4", "7"))
```





## Logical

`logical` is a type that only has two possible elements: `TRUE` and `FALSE`

```{r logical1}
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
class(x)
```

Note that `logical` elements are NOT in quotes. 
```{r logical2}
z <- c("TRUE", "FALSE", "TRUE", "FALSE")
class(z)
```

## Why is Class important?
The class of the data tells R how to process the data.
For example, it determines whether you can make summary statistics (numbers) or if you can sort alphabetically (characters).

## General Class Information

There is one useful functions associated with practically all R classes: 

`as.CLASS_NAME(x)` **coerces between classes**. It turns `x` into a certain class.

Examples:

- `as.numeric()`
- `as.character()`
- `as.logical()`
- `as.double()`
- `as.integer()`
- `as.Date()`
- `as.factor()` (More on this one later!)



## Coercing: seamless transition

Sometimes coercing works great!

```{r logical_coercion3s}
as.character(4)
as.numeric(c("1", "4", "7"))
as.logical(c("TRUE", "FALSE", "FALSE"))
as.logical(0)
```

## Coercing: not-so-seamless

When interpretation is ambiguous, R will return `NA` (an R constant representing "**N**ot **A**vailable" i.e. missing value)

```{r logical_coercions4}
as.numeric(c("1", "4", "7a"))
as.logical(c("TRUE", "FALSE", "UNKNOWN"))
```

## GUT CHECK!
What is one reason we might want to convert data to numeric?
A. So we can take the mean
B. So the data looks better
C. So our data is correct


## Number Subclasses

There are two major number subclasses or types

1) Double (1.003)
2) Integer (1)

## Double

`Double` is equivalent to `numeric`. It is a number that contains <span style="color: red;">fractional values </span>. Can be any amount of places after the decimal.

`Double` stands for [double-precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)

```{r double}
y <- c(1.1, 2.0, 3.21, 4.5, 5.62)
y
class(y)
typeof(y)
```

## Significant figures and other formats

The `num` function of the `tibble` package can be used to change format. See here for more: https://tibble.tidyverse.org/articles/numbers.html 



## Integer

`Integer` is a special number that contains only <span style="color: red;">whole numbers</span>.

```{r seq}
y
y_int <- as.integer(y)
y_int
class(y_int)
typeof(y_int)
```

## Integer

Can use `as.integer()` function to create integers (unless they are read in as integers or created as such with `seq` and `sample`). Otherwise, will be double by default.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # technically integers
class(x)
typeof(x)
```

## Checking double vs integer

A `tibble` will show the difference (as does `glimpse()`).

```{r}
my_data <- tibble(double_var = y, int_var = y_int)
my_data
glimpse(my_data)
```

## Factors

A `factor` is a special `character` vector where the elements have pre-defined groups or 'levels'. You can think of these as qualitative or categorical variables. Order is often important.

Examples:

- red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple
- breakfast, lunch, dinner
- baby, toddler, child, teen, adult
- Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral, Disagree, Strongly Disagree
- beginner, novice, intermediate, expert

## Factors

Use the `factor()` function to create factors.

```{r factor1}
x <- c("small", "medium", "large", "medium", "large")
class(x)

x_fact <- factor(x)
class(x_fact)
x_fact
```

Note that levels are, by default, in **alphanumerical** order!


## Factors

**Q:** Why not use `as.factor()` ?

**A:** You can coerce with `as.factor()`. But you can't specify levels! More on this soon. 

## Factors

You can learn what are the unique levels of a `factor` vector

```{r factor1b}
levels(x_fact)
```

More on how to change the levels ordering in a lecture coming up! 


## Factors

Factors can be converted to `numeric` or `character` very easily.

```{r factor3}
x_fact

as.character(x_fact)
as.numeric(x_fact)
```

## Class conversion in with a dataset

```{r, results='hide'}
circ <- read_csv("https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Charm_City_Circulator_Ridership.csv")
```

```{r}
head(circ)
```

## Class conversion in with a dataset

Say we want to change `daily` to be an integer. We would need to use `mutate()`. Let's create a new column 'daily_int' so it is easier to see what is happening. 

```{r}
circ %>% 
  mutate(daily_int= as.integer(daily)) %>% 
  select(daily, daily_int)
```


## Classes Overview

| Example 	| Class 	| Type 	| Notes 	|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| 1.1 	| Numeric 	| double 	| default for numbers 	|
| 1 	| integer 	| integer 	| Need to coerce to integer with as.integer() or use sample() or seq() with whole numbers	|
| "FALSE", "Ball" 	| Character 	| Character 	| Need quotes 	|
| FALSE, TRUE 	| logical 	| logical 	| No quotes 	|
| "Small", "Large" 	| Factor 	| Factor 	| Need to coerce to factor with factor() 	|

## Summary

- There are two types of number class objects: integer and double
- Logic class objects only have `TRUE` or `FALSE` (without quotes)
- `class()` can be used to test the class of an object x
- `as.CLASS_NAME(x)` can be used to change the class of an object x
- Factors are a special character class that has levels - more on that soon!
- tibbles show column classes!


# Two-dimensional data classes

## Two-dimensional data classes

Two-dimensional classes are those we would often use to store data read from a file 

* a data frame (`data.frame` or `tibble` class)

* a matrix (`matrix` class)

    * also composed of rows and columns
    * unlike `data.frame` or `tibble`, the entire matrix is composed of one R class
    * for example: all entries are `numeric`, or all entries are `character`


## Lists

* One other data type that is the most generic are `lists`.
* Can hold vectors, strings, matrices, models, list of other list!
* Lists are used when you need to do something repeatedly across lots of data - for example wrangling several similar files at once
* Lists are a bit more advanced but you may encounter them when you work with others or look up solutions

## Making Lists

* Can be created using `list()`
```{r makeList}
mylist <- list(c("A", "b", "c"), c(1, 2, 3))
mylist
class(mylist)
```



# Special data classes

## Dates

There are two most popular R classes used when working with dates and times: 

- `Date` class representing a calendar date
- `POSIXct` class representing a calendar date with hours, minutes, seconds

We convert data from character to `Date`/`POSIXct` to use functions to manipulate date/date and time

`lubridate` is a powerful, widely used R package from "tidyverse" family to work with `Date` / `POSIXct` class objects 

## Creating `Date` class object  

```{r, message = FALSE}
class("2021-06-15")

library(lubridate)

ymd("2021-06-15") # lubridate package Year Month Day
class(ymd("2021-06-15")) # lubridate package
class(date("2021-06-15")) # lubridate package
```

Note for  function `ymd`: **y**ear **m**onth **d**ay  

## The function must match the format

```{r}
mdy("06/15/2021")
dmy("15-June-2021")
ymd("2021-06-15")
```

## Dates are useful!

```{r}
a <- ymd("2021-06-15")
b <- ymd("2021-06-18")
a - b
```


## They right lubridate function needs to be used

Must match the data format!

```{r}
ymd("06/15/2021") # This doesn't work - gives NA
mdy("06/15/2021") # This works
```


##  Can also include hours, minutes, seconds  

```{r}
class("2013-01-24 19:39:07")
ymd_hms("2013-01-24 19:39:07") # lubridate package
```

UTC represents time zone, by default: Coordinated Universal Time

Note for  function `ymd_hms`: year month day hour minute second. 



## Class conversion in a dataset

Note dates are always displayed year month day, even if made with `mdy`!

```{r}
circ_dates <- circ %>% select(date)
circ_dates <- 
  circ_dates %>% mutate(date_formatted = mdy(date))
glimpse(circ_dates)
```


## Once a variable is a date type we can convert to other types

```{r}
circ_dates %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date_formatted)) %>%
  mutate(month = month(date_formatted)) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

# Other data classes

## Two-dimensional data classes

Two-dimensional classes are those we would often use to store data read from a file 
* a data frame (`data.frame` or `tibble` class)
* a matrix (`matrix` class)
    * also composed of rows and columns
    * unlike `data.frame` or `tibble`, the entire matrix is composed of one R class
    * for example: all entries are `numeric`, or all entries are `character`
## Lists
* One other data type that is the most generic are `lists`.
* Can hold vectors, strings, matrices, models, list of other list!
* Lists are used when you need to do something repeatedly across lots of data - for example wrangling several similar files at once
* Lists are a bit more advanced but you may encounter them when you work with others or look up solutions
## Making Lists
* Can be created using `list()`
```{r makeList}
mylist <- list(c("A", "b", "c"), c(1, 2, 3))
mylist
class(mylist)
```

## Summary

- coerce between classes using `as.numeric()` or `as.character()`
- data frames, tibbles, matrices, and lists are all classes of objects
- lists can contain multiples of any other class of data including lists!
- calendar dates can be represented with the `Date` class using `ymd()`, `mdy()` functions from [`lubridate` package](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)

# Extra Slides

## Matrices

`as.matrix()` creates a matrix from a data frame or tibble (where all values are the same class).

```{r,}
circ_mat <- select(circ, contains("orange")) %>%
  head(n = 3)
circ_mat
as.matrix(circ_mat)
```

## Matrices

`matrix()` creates a matrix from scratch.

```{r}
matrix(1:6, ncol = 2)
```


## More about Lists

List elements can be named

```{r makeListv}
mylist_named <- list(
  letters = c("A", "b", "c"),
  numbers = c(1, 2, 3),
  one_matrix = matrix(1:4, ncol = 2)
)
mylist_named
```


## Some useful functions from `lubridate` to manipulate `Date` objects

```{r}
x <- ymd(c("2021-06-15", "2021-07-15"))
x
day(x) # see also: month(x) , year(x)
x + days(10)
x + months(1) + days(10)
wday(x, label = TRUE)
```

## Some useful functions from `lubridate` to manipulate `POSIXct` objects

```{r}
x <- ymd_hms("2013-01-24 19:39:07")
x
date(x)
x + hours(3)
floor_date(x, "1 hour") # see also: ceiling_date()
```

## Differences in dates 

```{r}
x1 <- ymd(c("2021-06-15"))
x2 <- ymd(c("2021-07-15"))

difftime(x2, x1, units = "weeks")
as.numeric(difftime(x2, x1, units = "weeks"))
```

Similar can be done with time (e.g. difference in hours). 

# Data Selection

## Matrices

```{r matrix}
n <- 1:9
n
mat <- matrix(n, nrow = 3)
mat
```

## Vectors: data selection

To get element(s) of a vector (one-dimensional object): 

- Type the name of the variable and open the rectangular brackets `[ ]`
- In the rectangular brackets, type index (/vector of indexes) of element (/elements) you want to pull. **In R, indexes start from 1** (not: 0)

```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h")
x
x[2]
x[c(1, 2, 100)]
```



## Matrices: data selection

Note you cannot use `dplyr` functions (like `select`) on matrices. To subset matrix rows and/or columns, use `matrix[row_index, column_index]`.

```{r subset3}
mat
mat[1, 1] # individual entry: row 1, column 1
mat[1, 2] # individual entry: row 1, column 2
mat[1, ] # first row
mat[, 1] # first column

mat[c(1, 2), c(2, 3)] # subset of original matrix: two rows and two columns
```


## Lists: data selection

You can reference data from list using `$` (if elements are named) or using `[[ ]]`

```{r}
mylist_named[[1]]
mylist_named[["letters"]] # works only for a list with elements' names
mylist_named$letters # works only for a list with elements' names
```
