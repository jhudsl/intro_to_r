## Recap of Data Cleaning

test
-   `is.na()`,`any(is.na())`, `count()`, and functions from `naniar`
    like `gg_miss_var()` can help determine if we have `NA` values
-   `filter()` automatically removes `NA` values - can't confirm or deny
    if condition is met (need `| is.na()` to keep them)
-   `drop_na()` can help you remove `NA` values from a variable or an
    entire data frame
-   `NA` values can change your calculation results
-   think about what `NA` values represent

## Recap of Data Cleaning

-   `case_when()` can recode **entire values** based on conditions
    -   remember `case_when()` needs `TRUE ~ varaible` to keep values that aren't specified by conditions, otherwise will be `NA`
-   `stringr` package has great functions for looking for specific **parts of values** especially `filter()` and `str_detect()` combined
    - also has other useful string manipulation functions like `str_replace()` and more!
    - `separate()` can split columns into additional columns
    - `unite()` can combine columns

## Manipulating Data 

In this module, we will show you how to:

1. Reshape data from wide to long
2. Reshape data from long to wide
3. Merge Data/Joins

## What is wide/long data?

<div style="font-size:40pt">
Data is wide or long **with respect** to certain variables.
</div>

```{r, fig.alt="Wide versus long data rearanges the position of column names and row content.", out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pivot.jpg")
```

## What is wide/long data?

Data is stored *differently* in the tibble.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ex_wide <- tibble(State = "Alabama",
                 June_vacc_rate = 0.516,
                 May_vacc_rate = 0.514,
                 April_vacc_rate = 0.511
                     )
ex_long <- pivot_longer(ex_wide, cols = !State)
```

Wide: has many columns

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ex_wide
```

Long: column names become data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ex_long
```

## What is wide/long data?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ex_wide <- tibble(State = c("Alabama", "Alaska"),
                 June_vacc_rate = c(0.516, 0.627),
                 May_vacc_rate = c(0.514, 0.626),
                 April_vacc_rate = c(0.511, 0.623)
                     )
ex_long <- pivot_longer(ex_wide, cols = !State)
```

Wide: multiple columns per individual, values spread across multiple columns 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ex_wide
```

Long: multiple rows per observation, a single column contains the values

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ex_long
```

## What is wide/long data?

https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/blob/main/images/tidyr-pivoting.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif visualization of data going from wide to long form.", out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidyr_pivoting.gif")
```

## Why do we need to switch between wide/long data?

Wide: **Easier for humans to read**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ex_wide
```

Long: **Easier for R to make plots & do analysis**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ex_long
```

## Pivoting using `tidyr` package

`tidyr` allows you to "tidy" your data.  We will be talking about:

- `pivot_longer` - make multiple columns into variables, (wide to long)
- `pivot_wider` - make a variable into multiple columns, (long to wide)
- `separate` - string into multiple columns (review)

The `reshape` command exists.  Its arguments are considered more confusing, so we don't recommend it.

You might see old functions `gather` and `spread` when googling. These are older iterations of `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`, respectively.

# `pivot_longer`...

## Reshaping data from **wide to long** {.codesmall} 

`pivot_longer()` - puts column data into rows (`tidyr` package)

- First describe which columns we want to "pivot_longer"

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval=FALSE}
{long_data} <- {wide_data} %>% pivot_longer(cols = {columns to pivot})
```
</div>

## Reshaping data from **wide to long**

```{r, message = FALSE}
wide_vacc <- read_csv(
  file = "https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/wide_vacc.csv")
```

```{r}
wide_vacc
long_vacc <- wide_vacc %>% pivot_longer(cols = everything())
long_vacc
```

## Reshaping wide to long: Better column names {.codesmall} 

`pivot_longer()` - puts column data into rows (`tidyr` package)

- First describe which columns we want to "pivot_longer"
- `names_to =` new name for old columns
- `values_to =` new name for old cell values

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval=FALSE}
{long_data} <- {wide_data} %>% pivot_longer(cols = {columns to pivot},
                                        names_to = {name for old columns},
                                        values_to = {name for cell values})
```
</div>

## Reshaping data from **wide to long**

```{r}
wide_vacc
long_vacc <- wide_vacc %>% pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
                                        names_to = "Month",
                                        values_to = "Rate")
long_vacc
```

Newly created column names are enclosed in quotation marks.

## Data used: Charm City Circulator

http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Charm_City_Circulator_Ridership.csv

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(jhur)
circ <- read_circulator()
head(circ, 5)
```

## Mission: Taking the average boardings by line

Let's imagine we want to create a table of average boardings by route/line. Results should look something like:

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
example <- tibble(line = c("orange","purple","green","banner"),
                  avg_boardings = c("600(?)", "700(?)", "500(?)", "400(?)")
)
example
```

## Reshaping data from **wide to long**

```{r}
long <- circ %>% 
  pivot_longer(starts_with(c("orange","purple","green","banner")))
long
```

## Reshaping data from **wide to long**

Un-pivoted columns (`day`, `date`, `daily`) are similar

```{r}
circ %>% select(day, date, daily) %>% head()
long %>% select(day, date, daily) %>% head()
```

## Cleaning up long data

We will use `str_replace` from the `stringr` package to put `_` in the names

```{r}
long <- long %>% mutate(
  name = str_replace(string = name, pattern = "B", replacement = "_B"),
  name = str_replace(string = name, pattern = "A", replacement = "_A")
)
long
```

## Cleaning up long data with `separate()`

-  first argument - which column should be split up?
-  "`into =`" gives names to the new columns
-  "`sep =`" to show where the separation should happen.

```{r}
long <- long %>% 
  separate(name, into = c("line", "type"), sep = "_")
long
```

## Mission: Taking the average boardings by line

Filter by Boardings only..

```{r}
long <- long %>% 
  filter(type == "Boardings")
long
```

## Mission: Taking the average boardings by line

Now our data is more tidy, and we can take the averages easily!

```{r}
long %>% 
  group_by(line) %>% 
  summarize("avg_boardings" = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Reshaping data from **wide to long**

There are many ways to **select** the columns we want. Check out https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/dplyr_tidy_select.html to look at more column selection options.

```{r}
circ %>% 
  pivot_longer( !c(day, date, daily))
```

# `pivot_wider`...

## Reshaping data from **long to wide**

`pivot_wider()` - spreads row data into columns (`tidyr` package)

- `names_from =` the old column whose contents will be spread into multiple new column names.
- `values_from =` the old column whose contents will fill in the values of those new columns.

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval=FALSE}
{wide_data} <- {long_data} %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = {Old column name: contains new column names},
              values_from = {Old column name: contains new cell values})
```
</div>

## Reshaping data from **long to wide**

```{r}
long_vacc
wide_vacc <- long_vacc %>% pivot_wider(names_from = "Month", 
                                       values_from = "Rate") 
wide_vacc
```

## Reshaping Charm City Circulator

```{r}
long
```

## Reshaping Charm City Circulator

```{r}
wide <- long %>% pivot_wider(names_from = "type", 
                             values_from = "value") 
wide
```

## Summary

- `tidyr` package helps us convert between wide and long data
- `pivot_longer()` goes from wide -> long
     - Specify columns you want to pivot
     - Specify `names_to = ` and `values_to = ` for custom naming
- `pivot_wider()` goes from long -> wide
     - Specify `names_from =` and `values_from = `

## Joining

"Combining datasets"

```{r, fig.alt="Inner, outer, left, and right joins represented with venn diagrams", out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins.png")
```

## Joining in `dplyr`

* Merging/joining data sets together - usually on key variables, usually "id"
* `?join` - see different types of joining for `dplyr`
* `inner_join(x, y)` - only rows that match for `x` and `y` are kept
* `full_join(x, y)` - all rows of `x` and `y` are kept 
* `left_join(x, y)` - all rows of `x` are kept even if not merged with `y`
* `right_join(x, y)` - all rows of `y` are kept even if not merged with `x`
* `anti_join(x, y)` - all rows from `x` not in `y` keeping just columns from `x`.

## Merging: Simple Data

```{r message=FALSE}
data_As <- read_csv(
  file = "https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/data_As_1.csv")
data_cold <- read_csv(
  file = "https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/data_cold_1.csv")
```

```{r}
data_As
data_cold
```

## Inner Join

https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/blob/main/images/inner-join.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif showing the inner joining of two simple datasets.", out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/inner_join.gif")
```

## Inner Join

```{r inner_join}
ij <- inner_join(data_As, data_cold)
ij
```

## Left Join

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/main/images/left-join.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif showing the left joining of two simple datasets.", out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/left_join.gif")
```

## Left Join

"Everything to the left of the comma"

```{r left_join}
lj <- left_join(data_As, data_cold)
lj
```

## Install `tidylog` package to log outputs

```{r, include=FALSE}
# install.packages("tidylog")
library(tidylog)
```

```{r left_join_log}
# install.packages("tidylog")
library(tidylog)
left_join(data_As, data_cold)
```

## Right Join

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/main/images/right-join.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif showing the right joining of two simple datasets.", out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/right_join.gif")
```

## Right Join

"Everything to the right of the comma"

```{r right_join}
rj <- right_join(data_As, data_cold)
rj
```

## Left Join: Switching arguments

```{r right_join2}
lj2 <- left_join(data_cold, data_As)
lj2
```

## Full Join

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/main/images/full-join.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif showing the full joining of two simple datasets.", out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/full_join.gif")
```

## Full Join

```{r}
fj <- full_join(data_As, data_cold)
fj
```

## Watch out for "`includes duplicates`"

```{r message=FALSE}
data_As <- read_csv(
  file = "https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/data_As_2.csv")
data_cold <- read_csv(
  file = "https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/data_cold_2.csv")
```

```{r}
data_As
data_cold
```

## Watch out for "`includes duplicates`"

```{r}
lj <- left_join(data_As, data_cold)
```

## Watch out for "`includes duplicates`"

Data including the joining column ("State") has been duplicated.

```{r}
lj
```

<br>

Note that "Alaska willow ptarmigan" appears twice.

## Watch out for "`includes duplicates`"

https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/blob/main/images/left-join-extra.gif

```{r, fig.alt="A gif showing how data can be duplicated from one dataset when joining two simple datasets.", out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/left_join_extra.gif")
```

## Stop `tidylog`

`unloadNamespace()` does the opposite of `library()`.

```{r}
unloadNamespace("tidylog")
```

## Using the `by` argument

By default joins use the intersection of column names. If `by` is specified, it uses that.

```{r use_by}
full_join(data_As, data_cold, by = "State")
```

## Using the `by` argument

You can join based on multiple columns by using something like `by = c(col1, col2)`.

If the datasets have two different names for the same data, use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
full_join(x, y, by = c("a" = "b"))
```

## Getting the set difference with `setdiff`

We might want to determine what indexes ARE in the first dataset that AREN'T in the second.

For this to work, the datasets need the same columns.

We'll just select the index using `select()`.

```{r}
A_states <- data_As %>% select(State)
cold_states <- data_cold %>% select(State)
```

## Getting the set difference with `setdiff`

States in `A_states` but not in `cold_states`

```{r}
dplyr::setdiff(A_states, cold_states)
```

States in `cold_states` but not in `A_states`

```{r}
dplyr::setdiff(cold_states, A_states)
```

## Getting the set difference with `setdiff`

Why did we use `dplyr::setdiff`? 

There is a base R function, also called `setdiff` that requires vectors.

In other words, we use `dplyr::` to be specific about the package we want to use.

More set operations can be found here:
https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/setops.html

## Summary

* Merging/joining data sets together - assumes all column names that overlap
     - use the `by = c("a" = "b")` if they differ
* `inner_join(x, y)` - only rows that match for `x` and `y` are kept
* `full_join(x, y)` - all rows of `x` and `y` are kept 
* `left_join(x, y)` - all rows of `x` are kept even if not merged with `y`
* `right_join(x, y)` - all rows of `y` are kept even if not merged with `x`
* Use the `tidylog` package for a detailed summary
* `setdiff(x, y)` shows what in `x` is missing from `y`

# Additional Slides

## Inconsistencies in non-pivoted columns?

Notice "daily" column has different values

```{r echo = FALSE}
long2 <- long
long2[2,1] <- "MONDAY"
```

```{r}
long2
```

## Inconsistencies in non-pivoted columns?

R won't drop data while pivoting.

```{r}
wide2 <- long2 %>% pivot_wider(names_from = "type", 
                             values_from = "value") 
wide2
```

## Fast manipulation using `collapse` package

https://sebkrantz.github.io/collapse/

Might be helpful if your data is very large. However, `dplyr` and `tidyr` functions are great for most applications.
