## Factors

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

A `factor` is a special `character` vector where the elements have pre-defined groups or 'levels'. You can think of these as qualitative or categorical variables:

```{r factor1}
x <- c("yellow", "red", "red", "blue", "yellow", "blue")
class(x)

x_fact <- factor(x) # factor() is a function
class(x_fact)
```

## Factors

Factors have **levels** (character types do not).

```{r}
x
x_fact
```

<br>

Note that levels are, by default, in **alphanumerical** order.

## Factors

Extract the levels of a `factor` vector using `levels()`:

```{r}
levels(x_fact)
```

## `forcats` package

A package called `forcats` is really helpful for working with factors.

```{r, fig.alt="Forcats hex sticker", out.width = "30%", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/tidyverse/forcats/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png")
```

## `factor()` vs `as_factor()`

`factor()` is from base R and `as_factor()` is from `forcats`

Both can change a variable to be of class factor.

- `factor()` will order **alphabetically** unless told otherwise.
- `as_factor()` will  order by **first appearance** unless told otherwise.

If you are assigning your levels manually either function is fine!

## `as_factor()` function

```{r}
x <- c("yellow", "red", "red", "blue", "yellow", "blue")
x_fact_2 <- as_factor(x)
x_fact_2

# Compare to factor() method:
x_fact
```

## A Factor Example{.smaller}

We will use data on student dropouts from the State of California during the 2016-2017 school year. More on this data can be found here: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesdropouts.asp

To preserve school anonymity, "CDS_CODE" is used in place of the individual school's name.

You can download the data from the JHU website here: http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/dropouts.txt

```{r}
dropouts <- read_delim("http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/dropouts.txt", delim = "\t")
dropouts
```

## Preparing the data

Aggregate (sum) across ethnicity and gender:

```{r}
dropouts <-
  dropouts %>%
  group_by(CDS_CODE) %>%
  summarize(
    Freshman = sum(D9),
    Sophomore = sum(D10),
    Junior = sum(D11),
    Senior = sum(D12)
  )
dropouts
```

## Preparing the data

Pivot to long format:

```{r}
dropouts <-
  dropouts %>%
  pivot_longer(
    !CDS_CODE,
    names_to = "grade",
    values_to = "n_dropouts"
  )
dropouts
```

## The data

```{r}
head(dropouts)
```

Notice that `grade` is a `chr` variable. This indicates that the values are **character** strings. 

R does not realize that there is any order related to the `grade` values. It will assume that it is **alphabetical**. 

However, we know that the order is: **freshman**, **sophomore**, **junior**, **senior**.

## For the next steps, let's take a subset of data.

Use `set.seed()` to take the same random sample each time.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
dropouts_subset <- slice_sample(dropouts, n = 32)
```

## Plot the data

Let's make a plot first.

```{r, fig.height= 3}
dropouts_subset %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = grade, y = n_dropouts)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16) # make all labels size 16
```

OK this is very useful, but it is a bit difficult to read. We expect the values to be plotted by the order that we know, not by alphabetical order. 

## Change to factor

Currently `grade` is class `character` but let's change that to class `factor` which allows us to specify the levels or order of the values.

```{r}
dropouts_fct <-
  dropouts_subset %>%
  mutate(grade = factor(grade,
    levels = c("Freshman", "Sophomore", "Junior", "Senior")
  ))

dropouts_fct %>%
  pull(grade) %>%
  levels()
```

## Change to a factor

```{r}
head(dropouts_fct)
```

## Plot again

Now let's make our plot again:

```{r, fig.height= 3}
dropouts_fct %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = grade, y = n_dropouts)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
```

Now that's more like it! Notice how the data is automatically plotted in the order we would like.

## What about if we `arrange()` the data by grade ?{.smaller}

Character data is arranged alphabetically.

```{r}
dropouts_subset %>%
  arrange(grade)
```

Notice that the order is not what we would hope for!

## Arranging Factors{.smaller}

Factor data is arranged by level.

```{r}
dropouts_fct %>%
  arrange(grade)
```

Nice! Now this is what we would want!

## Making tables with characters

Tables grouped by a character are arranged alphabetically.

```{r}
dropouts_subset %>%
  group_by(grade) %>%
  summarize(total_dropouts = sum(n_dropouts))
```

## Making tables with factors

Tables grouped by a factor are arranged by level.

```{r}
dropouts_fct %>%
  group_by(grade) %>%
  summarize(total_dropouts = sum(n_dropouts))
```

## `forcats` for ordering{.smaller}

What if we wanted to order `grade` by increasing `n_dropouts`? 

```{r, fig.height= 3}
library(forcats)

dropouts_fct %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = grade, y = n_dropouts)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
```

This would be useful for identifying easily which grade to focus on.

## forcats for ordering{.smaller}

We can order a factor by another variable by using the `fct_reorder()` function of the `forcats` package.

<div class = "codeexample">
```{r, eval=FALSE}
fct_reorder({column getting changed}, {guiding column}, {summarizing function})
```
</div>

## forcats for ordering{.smaller}

We can order a factor by another variable by using the `fct_reorder()` function of the `forcats` package.

```{r, fig.height= 3}
library(forcats)

dropouts_fct %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = fct_reorder(grade, n_dropouts, mean), y = n_dropouts)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Student Grade") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
```

## forcats for ordering.. with `.desc = ` argument{.smaller}

```{r, fig.height= 3}
library(forcats)

dropouts_fct %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = fct_reorder(grade, n_dropouts, mean, .desc = TRUE), y = n_dropouts)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Student Grade") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 16)
```

## forcats for ordering.. can be used to sort datasets

```{r, fig.height= 3}
dropouts_fct %>% pull(grade) %>% levels() # By year order
dropouts_fct <- dropouts_fct %>%
  mutate(
    grade = fct_reorder(grade, n_dropouts, mean)
  )
dropouts_fct %>% pull(grade) %>% levels() # by increasing mean dropouts
```

## Checking Proportions with `fct_count()`

The `fct_count()` function of the `forcats` package is helpful for checking that the proportions of each level for a factor are similar. Need the `prop = TRUE` argument otherwise just counts are reported.

```{r}
dropouts_fct %>%
  pull(grade) %>%
  fct_count(prop = TRUE)
```

## Summary
- the factor class allows us to have a different order from alphanumeric for categorical data
- we can change data to be a factor variable using `mutate` and a factor creating function like `factor()` or `as_factor`
- the `as_factor()` is from the  `forcats` package (first appearance order by default)
- the `factor()` base R function (alphabetical order by default)
- with `factor()` we can specify the levels with the `levels` argument if we want a specific order
- the `fct_reorder({variable_to_reorder}, {variable_to_order_by}, {summary function})` helps us reorder a variable by the values of another variable
- arranging, tabulating, and plotting the data will reflect the new order
