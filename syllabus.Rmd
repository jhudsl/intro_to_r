Overview: This course will provide "hands-on" training for learning how to analyze data in the R statistical software package. We will cover data input/output, data management and manipulation, and how to make useful and informative graphics
 
Course Format: Each class will consist of 2 or 3 hour-long modules: each module features an "interactive" lecture (where students can work follow along on their laptops) and an R programming lab, where student apply the skills taught in the modules to real data. 

By the end of the course, students should be comfortable:

- Reading data into R
- Recoding and manipulating data
- Using R add-on packages
- Making exploratory plots
- Performing basic statistical tests
- Understanding basic programming syntax
- Creating reproducible R documents
