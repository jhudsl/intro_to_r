# Day 0

## Objectives

Upon completion of this session, you will be able to do the following:

1. Successfully install R and RStudio.
2. Install your first R packages.

## Material

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# The str_replace_all creates an absolute url to linked documents. Important because there are word and pdf rendered versions of the syllabus.
# The filter() step removes all dates but this date to make a smaller table.
pander::pandoc.table(
  schedule  %>%
    mutate(across(
      .fns = ~ str_replace_all(., "\\./", "https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/")
    )) %>%
    filter(
      row_number() >= which(str_detect(schedule$`**Day**`, "\\[Day 0\\]")) &
        row_number() < which(str_detect(schedule$`**Day**`, "\\[Day 1\\]"))
    ),
  missing = "",
  split.tables = Inf,
  style = "rmarkdown"
)
```
