140.604.73**

**Class Website:** http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/   
**CoursePlus:** https://courseplus.jhu.edu/core/index.cfm/go/syl:syl.public.view/coid/16733/

**Zoom link will be emailed to students.**

**Day/Time:** Jan 10 - 21: 8:30AM-11:50AM on Zoom

**Instructors:** Carrie Wright (cwrigh60@jhu.edu), Ava Hoffman (ava.hoffman@jhu.edu), and Candace Savonen (csavone1@jhu.edu)

**TAs:**  Grant Schumock (gschumo1@jhmi.edu) and Qier Meng(qmeng11@jhmi.edu)

**Communication will mainly occur through Slack and we will email you about how to connect to slack.**

**Overview:** This course will provide **"hands-on" training** for learning how to analyze data in the R statistical software package. We will cover data input/output, data management and manipulation, and how to make useful and informative graphics

**Course Format:** Each class will consist of 2 or 3 hour-long modules: each module features a lecture and an R programming lab, where students apply the skills taught in the modules to real data.

By the end of the course, students should be comfortable:

- Reading data into R
- Recoding and manipulating data
- Using R add-on packages
- Making exploratory plots
- Performing basic statistical tests
- Understanding basic programming syntax
- Creating reproducible R documents
