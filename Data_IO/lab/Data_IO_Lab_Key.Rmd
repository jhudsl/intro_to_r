# Part 1

1. Read in the Youth Tobacco study from URL 
http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv
and assign it to a variable named `youth`. 

```{r}
library(readr)
youth <- read_csv("http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Youth_Tobacco_Survey_YTS_Data.csv")
```

2. Use `head()` to display the first few rows of the data frame. 

```{r}
head(youth)
```

3. Use `spec()` to display the list of column names and their type specification. 

```{r}
spec(youth)
```

4. Load the `readxl` package with the `library()` command. 

If it is not installed, install it via: `RStudio --> Tools --> Install Packages`. You can also try `install.packages("readxl")`.

```{r}
library(readxl)
```

5. Download the dataset of monuments from: http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Monuments.xlsx file to `Monuments.xlsx`.

```{r}
download.file("http://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/data/Monuments.xlsx",
              destfile = "Monuments.xlsx",
              overwrite = TRUE, 
              mode = "wb")
```

6. Use the `read_excel()` function in the `readxl` package to read the `Monuments.xlsx` file and call the output `mon`. 

```{r}
mon <- read_excel("Monuments.xlsx")
```


# Part 2

7. Learn your working directory by running `getwd()`

```{r}
getwd()
```

8. Write out the `mon` object as a CSV file calling it "monuments.csv", using `write_csv()`. Where is the file now?

```{r}
write_csv(mon, "monuments.csv")
```


# Bonus

9. Write one of the variables from the Basic R lab to your working directory in `rds` format. Call the file `my_variable.rds`.

```{r}
y <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
write_rds(y, "my_variable.rds")
```
