<!-- `r config::get("holiday")` -->

There is an assignment due before class to [install software](modules/Setup/Setup.html) and we recommend completing HW 1 (uploading a screenshot showing that you finished the Swirl module indicated below) before class, but all other assignments will be due `r config::get("final_due_date")`. You are welcome to turn assignments in earlier if you wish.
