<!-- `r config::get("holiday")` -->

There is an assignment due before class to [install software](modules/Setup/Setup.html) and we recommend completing HW 1 (uploading a screenshot showing that you finished the Swirl module indicated below) before class, but all other assignments will be due `r config::get("final_due_date")`. You are welcome to turn assignments in earlier if you wish.

## Detailed Schedule + Materials

```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# The str_replace_all creates an absolute url to linked documents since there are word and pdf rendered versions of the syllabus
source("scripts/utils.R")
pander::pandoc.table(
  read_markdown("docs/_schedule_table.Rmd") %>%
    mutate(across(
      .fns = ~ str_replace_all(., "\\./", "https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_r/")
    )),
